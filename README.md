# Supporting Customers Through Online Skincare Purchases
In this group project, our team of three collaborated to built our first chatbot: SkinClaire.  We invented SkinClaire to support online retailing in the skin-care product subcategory.

The bot is designed to cater to the discovery and evaluation stages of the consumer journey, which - in this subcategory - are characterized by prolonged research and high-touch interactions. By offering personalized assistance over chat, it alleviates the need for in-person consultations on minor topics, saving valuable employee time. Further, the data gathered from bot interactions could be harnessed to make further customer experience improvements

This proof of concept code includes three key scenarios:
1) Sentiment Analysis for Tipping Point Purchase Decisions (this is the scenario which I owned)
2) Customer-Centered Product Recommendation
3) Skin Sensitivity Ingredient Screening
